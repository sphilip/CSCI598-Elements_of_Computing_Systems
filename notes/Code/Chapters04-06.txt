Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Flashlight
------------------------------------
circuit is a circle

electron and electricity derived from ancient Greek word elektron, meaning amber
(the glasslike hardened sap of trees)
	-b/c ancient Greeks experimented with rubbing amber with wool, which produced 
	static electricity
	-rubbing wool on amber causes the wool to pick up electrons from the amber.
	-wool winds up with more electrons than protons & amber ends up with fewer 
	electrons than protons
	
protons held together by "strong force", which is stronger than the repulsion of 
like charges
	Messing around with the strong force involves splitting the nucleus, which 
	produces nuclear energy
	
chemicals in batteries are chosen st reactions b/w them generate spare electrons 
on the negative terminal (anode) and demand extra electrons on the positive 
terminal (cathode)
	thus, chemical energy is converted to electrical energy
	reaction can't proceed unless some way that the extra electrons can be taken 
	away from the negative terminal of the battery and delivered back to the 
	positive terminal

Electrons orbit the nucleus in various levels (shells)

An atom that has just one electron in its outer shell can readily give up that electron, which is what's necessary to carry electricity. 
   	conducive to carrying electricity and called conductors

insulator = substance w/very high resistance (doesn't conduct electricity)
	ie. Rubber and plastics
	
longer wire = higher resistance

thicker wire = lower resistance 
	thickness of the wire allows more electrons to move through the wire
	
voltage = potential for doing work
	named after Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), invented 1st battery in 1800
	
amperes from Andre Marie Ampere (1775-1836)

1 A = 6.24x10^18 electrons per second

ohm from Georg Simon Ohm (1789-1854)

If the battery is big enough, the wire will get hot because the electrical
energy is being converted to heat. If the wire gets very hot, it will actually
glow and might even melt

lightbulb has a filament (a thin wire), made from tungsten. 
	One end of filament connected to the tip at the bottom of the base
	the other end is connected to the side of the metal base
	ends are separated from the tip by an insulator
	resistance of the wire causes it to heat up
	In open air, the tungsten would get hot enough to burn
	in vacuum of the lightbulb, the tungsten glows and gives off light
	
watt from James Watt (1736-1819)



Chapter 5: Seeing Around Corners
----------------------------------
thick wire conducts much better than a thin wire

To use the earth as a conductor, have to use something that maintains a
substantial contact with the earth
	can use a copper pole at least 8 feet long and 0.5 inch in diameter or the 		
	cold-water pipes (if made of copper and originate in the ground outside the 
	house)
	
earth has too much resistance for low-voltage batteries

gauged wires 
	thickness of wire is measured in American Wire Gauge (AWG)
	smaller the AWG # = thicker wire = less resistance
	thicker wires = more expensive


Chapter 6: Telegraphs and Relays
---------------------------------

telegraph ("far writing") relies on electromagnetics
	wrap wire arounds iron bar (enough wire to create resistance)
	applying electricity creates a magnetic field
	uses a key as a switch

@ end of the wire is a receiver which was an electromagnet pulling a metal lever
      	a wound-up spring slowly pulled a roll of paper through the gadget, & 
      	a pen bounced to draw dots/dashes 
	person transcribes code into english

for long distances, need to use relay (an in-between telegraph station)
    	cheap amplification since signal decreases as length of wire (resistance) increases
	can use incoming signal to attract a wire to send identical msg (via 
	electromagnet)
	ie. incoming mesg (in form of electrical signals) creates magnetic field which attracts a wire (acting as a switch) to complete the circuit of another 
	telegraph
