Chapter 12: A Binary Adding Machine
-------------------------------------
half adder:
     2 inputs (a,b)
     sum out = xor
     carry out = and gate
     fails to add possible carry in from previous addition

full adder:
     3 inputs (a,b,carry in)
     2 half adders
     sum out = sum out of 1st adder
     carry out = or gate w/1st, 2nd carry out

ripple-carry
	total speed = # of bits * speed of Full Adder

look-ahead carry = more circuitry speeds up adding

Chapter 13: Subtraction
-------------------------
minuend - subtrahend = difference

to subtract:
   step 1. flip bits of subtrahend (one's complement)
   step 2. add minuend to flipped bits
   step 3. +1 to step 2
   step 4. 
   	when original minued < minuend: result - 100000
	else 1111111-result

overflow = # greater than # of input bits

underflow = negative #
