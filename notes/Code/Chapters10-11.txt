Chapter 10: Logic and Switches
--------------------------------
to ancient greeks, logic= means of analyzing language in search for truth

basis of Aristotle's logic was syllogism

syllogism = 2 premises are assumed true & a conclusion is deduced

George Boole
	son of shoemaker and maid
	able to attend school for rich
	invented type of algebra that looks/acts like conventional algebra
		contains: operands (letters/#s)
							operators (how operands are combined)
							made operands refer to classes (group of things->set)
							+ = union (or)
							* = intersection (and)							
							1 = universe
							0 = empty class
							
algebraic rules (for +,*)
	1. communitive: a+b=b+a
	2. associative: a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c
	3. distributive: a*(b+c) = (a*b)+(a*c)
	
	
Chapter 11: Gates (not Bill)
------------------------------
logic gates = allow/ block flow of current

boolean algebra & circuits combined by Claude Elwood Shannon (1916-)

switch connects to electromagnet (battery + inductor)
	if on, battery=on, inductor has magnetic field
	
double-throw relay = 2 outputs that are electrically opposite (if 1 has voltage,
	other doesn't)

buffer = used when input is weak/ signal is slightly weak

Boole inspired to investigate logic b/c of the works of Augustus de Morgan 
(9yrs older than Boole, released book same day as Boole)
