Chapter 18: From Abaci to Chips
---------------------------------
development of # systems an early tool to help keep track of commodities & 
property
		ancient Greeks/native Americans used pebbles/kernels of grain
		Europeans used counting boards
		Middle East developed the abacus
			introduced by traders to China in 1200 AD
			
logarithms
	developed by John Napier (Scottish mathematician, 1550-1617)
	to find the product of 2 #s:
		look up each # from table of logarithms
		calc sum
		use table in reverse to find actual product
	log table only contained values for certain #s
	    	#s in b/w calculated w/ interpolation (using differences)
	instead of tables, use a slide rule
		orignally by Edmund Gunter (1581-1626)
		refined by William Oughtred (1574-1660)
		last made in 1976 by Keuffel & Esser Company
				
computer = hired person who calculates #s
		log & trig tables necessary for nautical navigation
				
Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
	wanted to remove error from the tables
	1820-1833 - created Difference Engine
		to automate process of constructing & printing a table
		multidigit decimal #s represented by geared wheels placed in 1 of 10 
			positions
		negatives handled w/10's complement
		mechanical adding machine
		abandoned by 1833
		eventually created by Georg & Edvard Cheutz (1853)
	1833-1871 - created Analytical Engine
		closest thing to computer
		engine contained a store (ie. memory) & mill (ALU)
		multiplication done via multiple additions
 		division       "     "	"      " subtractions
		can be programmed via cards (adapted from Jaquard pattern-weaving loom)
	1st person to understand importance of needing a conditional jump

1890 US census
  Census office feared that 1890 census info would take more time (>7yrs) 
        	to process, wanted to automate process
	chose machinery developed by Herman Hollerith (1860-1929, worked as 
					statistician for 1880 census)
	
Herman Hollerith (1860-1929)
       worked as statistician for 1880 census
       Census office feared that 1890 census info would take more time (>7yrs)
       	to process, wanted to automate process & chose his machine
       created tabulation machine 
       	       used manila punch cards (6.625x3.25 inches)
       	       	    holes arranged into 24 columns of 12 positions (288 total 
       	       	    positions)
		    census taker indicates applicable characteristics by making a .25 inch 
		    	square hole into appropriate position on the card
	       	    ex. age indicated via 2 holes (1st = 5 year span of ages
	       	        (0-4,5-9,10-14,etc); 2nd = 1 of 5 possible holes for precise 
	       	        age in range of 1st hole)-> coding age needs total of 28 
	       	        positions
	       	    didn't use binary b/c of cases where all holes would need to be 
	       	    	punched, become structually unstable
	       operator pressed a board containing 288 spring-loaded pins on each card
	       pins that matched the punched holes in the cards came into contact w/
	       		pool of mercury to complete eletrical circuit
	       	    triggered electromagnet to increment decimal counter
	       sort cards via sorting machine
		    used hand press like the tabulation machine
		    had electromagnets to open a hatch to 1 of 26 separate sections
		    operator needed to drop card into that section & close hatch
 	1890 census info
	       processed >62 million cards
	       contained 2x info from 1880
	       data processes in 1/3 of time
	1896 - founded Tabulating Machine Company 
	1911 - through mergers, became Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (C-T-R)
	1914 - Thomas J. Watson became president of CTR
	**1924 - Watson changed name of company to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)**
	
Conrad Zuse (1910-1995) - engineering student
       1935 - built 1st relay computer 
       used binary #s but used mechanical memory (not relays) @ 1st
       punched holes into 35mm movie film to program

George Stibitz (1904-1995) - Bell Telephone Labs
       took home telephone relays & created a 1-bit adder @ home (in kitchen)
       1939 - adder became the Complex # Computer

Howard Aiken (1900-1973) - Harvard grad student
       wanted to do lots of repetive calculations
       led to working w/IBM
       1943 - created Automated Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC)
       	    Harvard Mark I - 1st digital computer to print tables
	    	    	 II - largest relay-based machine (used 13000 relays)
			    relays tended to fail
			    	   b/c relays are bendable pieces of metal, could eventually break
				   piece of dirt or paper stuck b/w contacts
			    **moth stuck in relay = 1st bug being found**

replacement for relays = vacuum tubes
	developed by John Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945) & Lee de Forest (1873-1961) for 
		the radio
	tubes used to amplify telephones, radio signals
	can be wired into AND/OR/etc gates
	problems: expensive
		  needed lots of electricity
		  generated lots of heat
		  burned out
		  when used in computer, not immediately known
	benefits: tubes can switch in 1 microsecond (1000x faster than relays - can 
		switch in 1ms)
	overall computing speed linked to speed that machine reads in program from 
		paper
	1945 = relays replaced w/tubes in computers

Alan Turing (1912-1954)
     	contributed to Colossus computer (1943) to break the German code-making 
     		machine
     	2 papers: 1. "computability" = analysis of the ability of a computer
	  	     		     Turing Machine - abstract model of a computer
		  2. Turing test = machine intelligence (AI) test

ENIAC = electrical numerical integrator & computer (1945)
      Moore School of Electrical Engineering (University of Pennsylvania)
      J.Presper Eckert & John Mauchly
      30 tons, 18000 tubes, largest computer
      used decimal #s internally
      operator must throw switches & plug in cables to use computer

EDVAC = electrical discrete variable automatic computer (1949)
      sucessor to ENIAC, concept created before ENIAC operational
      got John von Neumann (1903-1957) interested to join	
      von Neumann architecture:	use binary internally
      	  	  		have as much memory as possible to store code & data
				instructions sequential in memory & addressed w/program counter, allow conditional jumps
      von Neumann bottleneck = von Neu machine spends alot of time fetching 
      	instr
      	  solns: 1. mercury delay line memory (mid 1940s)
	  	 	 5 ft tubes of mercury
			 1 end of tube sent pulses into mercury 1ms apart
			 pulses take 1ms to travel to other end (detected like sound waves &
			  routed to beginning)
			 result: each tube stored 1MB of data
			 mercury used to minimize energy loss & echoes when signal transmitted 
			 	from piezoelectric quartz crystal to medium and back (same acoustic 
			 	impedance)
		 2. magnetic core memory (1947)
		    	 large arrays of magnetized metal rings strung w/wires
			 each ring stored 1 bit
Claude Shannon (1916)
       1938 - relationship b/w switches, relays & boolean algebra
       1948 - paper "A mathemetical theory of communication" while working for 
       	Bell Telephone Lab
       	    **introduced "bit"
	    est. information theory = transmitting digital info in presence of noise &
	    	 how to compensate

UNIVAC - universal automatic computer (1951)
       by Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation
       1st commercially available computer & 1st computer delivered to Bureau of
        Census
       on TV (on CBS) to predict 1952 presidential election results
       
transistor (1947)
       constructed w/slab of germanium (semiconductor) & strip of gold foil 
       	(very good conductor)
       by John Bardeen & Walter Brattain @ Bell Labs
       idea by William Shockley (boss of Bardeen & Brattain)
       benefits: don't require vacuums
                 needs less power => less heat => last longer
                 able to operate by battery
       1st application = hearing aids
       everything made w/relays can be made w/transistors
                 AND gate = 2 transistors in series
                 OR gate = 2 transistors w/ emitters connected to ground & 
                 	collector = source voltage
semiconductor = conductance can be changed via doping (combined w/impurities)
	N vs P-type semiconductors
	transistors made into amplifiers by sandwiching (ie. NPN)
	     base,emitter,collector
	     small voltage applied to base controls larger voltage from collector to 
	     	emitter
	     no base voltage = transistor is off

integrated circuit (IC) = layers of thin Si wafers that are precisely doped & 
	etched in different areas to form microscopic components
	   creating 1 is expensive => mass productions lowers overall cost
	   invented by Jack Kilby (Texas Instruments 1958) & separately by Robert
	    Noyce (Fairchild Semiconductor Corp 1959)
	   	    Noyce left Shockley Semiconductor Labs to start Fairchild
	   chip is delicate, must be protected & able to provide way for components 
	   	in the chip to be accessed
	   propogation time = time needed for a change in inputs to be reflected @ 
	   	output

small-scale integration (SSI) = chip w/ <10 logic gates
medium-scale		(MSI) = 10 -> 100 gates
large-scale		(LSI) = 100 -> 5000 
very-large-scale	(VLSI) = 5000 -> 50,000
super-large-scale	(SLSI) = 50,000 -> 100,000
ultra-large-scale	(ULSI) = >100,000 gates

TTL vs CMOS - mid 1970s
    TTL = transistor-transistor logic
    	needs constant source of power (plug in voltage source)
	short range of acceptable input voltage
	      too little voltage = chip doesn't work
	      too high voltage = chip breaks
	7400 series of chips implement AND/OR/DFF/etc gates
	not good to make RAM (ie. RAM64K needs 2048 RAM256 chips)
	    	 as an oscillator (for clock signals)   
    CMOS = complementary metal oxide semiconductor
    	large range of acceptable input voltage
	needs less power -> can use battery
	lack of speed

negative logic = when low voltage is called logical high & high voltage is 
	called logical low
	
printed circuit board
	board has holes & covered w/thin layer of copper foil
	use acid to etch away @ copper to solder IC sockets onto the board
	preserve areas w/o circuitry w/acid resistant substance

early 1971 - Intel 1st to put entire processor on a single chip
      Intel started by Robert Noyce (IC coinventor) & Gordon Moore (Moore's Law)
      also created the Intel 4004
      	   2300 transistors
	   4-bit microprocessor (data pats only 4-bits wide)
	   max clock speed = 108,000 cycles/sec = 108KHz
	   addressable memoery = 640 bytes

clock speed = max speed an oscillator can change for a microprocessor to work
