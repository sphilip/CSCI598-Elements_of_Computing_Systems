Chapter 19: 2 classic microprocessors
---------------------------------------
control signals:
	reset = reset microprocessor
	WR = microprocessor needs to write byte of memory into RAM (corresponds to 
		the write input of RAM)
	irq = interrupt signal
	
ie. max speed of 2MHz => clock cycle = 1/2000000 = 500ns

2 of 6 registers = H,L
	H = high-order byte
	L = low-order byte
	together used to address memory
	
direct addressing

indexed addressing

immediate addressing

sequential access = ie. microfilm, tape storage
	all memory stored in order of encounter
	
parity = poor form of error checking

memory-mapped IO = input/output devices replace addresses normally used for RAM

little vs big endian 
	result of Intel(little) vs Motorola(big) methods of storing multibyte
		memory addresses

PowerPC (by Apple) are microprocessors developed by Motorola, IBM & Apple
	designed w/RISC (reduced instruction set  computing) to increase speed of 
		processor through simplification of instruction set
	memory access only done via load & store
	lots of registers to avoid frequent access of memory
