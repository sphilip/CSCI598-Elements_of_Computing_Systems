Chapter 20: ASCII
-------------------
variable-width code - use shorter codes for frequently used letters & longer for
		 rarer codes (no differentiation b/w upper & lower case)
   ie. morse

fixed-width code - letters represented by fixed # of codes
   ie. braille

use shift code to change context from letter=> #s & use shift code again to 
	return to original context

need code to represent whitespace

Baudot code
       Emile Baudot (officer @ French Telegraph Services) developed code for 
       1874 printing telegraph
       1877: code adopted in FTS
       1931: code modified by Donald Murray & standardized by CCITT (Comite 
       		Consultatif International Telegraphique) aka ITU (international 
       		telecommunication union)
       5-bit code
       has codes to represent carriage return & line feed

carriage return = pushing button/lever on typewritter to move carriage to right
	 (so printing occurs on left) 

line feed = roll carriage so new line is beneath old line (as part of carriage 
	return)

ASCII 
      american std code for information interchange
      formalized 1967
      standard for organization of codes representing each letter/#/punctuation
      usu 7-bit code stored as 8-bits
      problem: doesn't include non-American characters
      extended ASCII character set: additional 256 codes to define other 
      	characters

soft hyphen = hyphen used to separate syllables in middle of words (only used 
	to break a word b/w 2 lines)

unicode
	1988: alternative to ASCII to incorporate all types (ie languages) of 
		characters
	16-bit code
	1st 128 characters = ASCII
	problem: 1 character = 1 byte of storage
		 needed space grows exponentially as # of characters increases
