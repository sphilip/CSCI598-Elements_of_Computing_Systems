Chapter 21: Get on the Bus
----------------------------

bus = collection of digital signals sent to every board in the computer
    4 types:
      1. address signals = made by microprocessor, used to address RAM
      2. data output = by microprocessor, used to write data to RAM; becomes in	
      		put signal to components using this signal
      3. data input = signals from other parts, read by microprocessor; usu. 
      		from RAM, how microprocessor reads from memory
      4. control signals = extra signals used to control microprocessor
    supplies power to the other boards

different components communicate via bus

bus contains:
    motherboard
    expansion slots = sockets in  motherboard
    expansion boards = circuit boards that fit into the slots	 
    
8 interrupt signals so components get immediate CPU time
  ie. pressing key on keyboard

buses replaced when # of address signals needed increases/ microprocessors 
	are faster
	  radio frequency interference = buses operating @ slower speeds than 
	  microprocessor

read access time = time needed for data output to be valid after address is 
	inputted (in ns)

bank = set of chips wired together to store a whole byte (ie. collection of 
	RAM to make larger array of RAM)

dual inline package (DIP)
     wire a memory board to specify which components correspond to specific 
     	address

tri-state = 3 possible output states (hi, lo, nothing)
	  essential to the operation of a bus

SRAM = static RAM
     needs 4 transistors per bit of memory
     retain memory as long as there's power

DRAM = dynamic RAM
     needs 1 transistor per bit of memory
     need more complex support circuitry		
     requires refresh cycle

refresh cycle = contents are accessed often, even if contents aren't needed

SIMM = single inline memory modules

DIMM = dual inline memory module

video display adapter =	signal to video display

video board = spot for the video display adapter
      includes character generator (has pixel patterns for all ASCII char) usu 
      	ROM

graphics board = video board not restricted to text

scan line = each horizontal line that the video is displayed on the monitor

horizontal retrace = movement to the next row to draw the pixels 

vertical retrace = movement from bottom right-hand corner to top left-hand to 
	start horizontal retrace

bandwidth = upper limit to speed that something can respond to a given signal

each character of text identified by:
      7-bit ASCII code
      64-bit visual appearance code 

ROM = read-only memory, no data input

scan code = computer program to determine what ASCII code corresponds to a 
	particular key being pressed

long-term storage devices
	  paper/cards -> not efficient or reusable
	  ***magnetic storage - Oberlin Smith***
	  	   created 20 yrs later by Valdemar Poulsen as answering machine 
		   	   electromagnet magnetizes a moving wire proportional to waveform of 
		   	   	the sound
			   magnetized wire can induce current to same degree as it's moved along 
			   		coils of wire in magnet
		   **cassette tape = paper tape made w/celluluse acetate base coated w/iron 
		   			particles
		   	   not ideal b/c unable to move to arbitrary spot on tape
		   magnetic disk - geometrically better for fast access 
	  	   	   invented before cassette for audio recording
			   **floppy disk** = single sheet of coated plastic w/i protective casing
			   		(cardboard, then plastic)
			   **hard disk** = multiple metal disks built into drive
			   	  surface divided into tracks (concentric rings)
				  each track divided into sectors (like slices of pie)
			   comes w/own electrical interface & interface for microprocessor
			   hard drive interfaces:
			   	SCSI = small computer system interface
				ESDI = enhanced small device interface
				IDE = integrated device electronics
