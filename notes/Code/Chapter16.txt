Chapter 16: Assembling Memory
-------------------------------

function of memory: to keep any info intact b/w time of writing & reading

flip flop can store 1 bit of information

D-type ff:







for multibyte input, can use:
    1) multiple 1-bit ff & connect write input together (ie. save 1, 8-bit #)
    2) 1 data-in & 1 data-out (ie. to save 8, 1-bit #)
       	   data-out of each ff connects to 8-3 mux
	   write signal connects to 3-8 dmux (8 outputs= 8 inputs to ff)
	   value @ desired address used as selector for both mux, dmux
	   called RAM 8x1: 8, 1-bit ff

2nd method = RAM
    random access memory
    random access = each of 8 ff can be read/written by changing address
    	   - vs memory that must be read sequentially
	   - combine 2 RAM8:
	     	     1-2 dmux
		     (2) RAM8
		     2-1 mux
	   - volatile memory = needs constant supply of electricity to retain contents

1 kilobyte (KB) = 1024 bytes
     Greek khilioi = 1000
     2^10 = 1024 ~= 1000
     1 KB has:
       8 data inputs
       8 data outputs
       10 address inputs

1 megabyte (MB) = 1024 KB
     Greek megas = great

1 gigabyte (GB) = 1024 MB
     Greek gigas = giant

1 terabyte (TB) = 1024 GB)
     Greek teras = monster

petabyte = 2^50 bytes
exabyte = 2^60 bytes

bits = # of bytes * 8

if 1 ff (RAM 1x1) has 9 relays => RAM 64Kx8 has 5 million relays
