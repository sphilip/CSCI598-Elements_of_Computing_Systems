Chapter 15:Bytes & Hex
------------------------
data path = # of bits that travel from gate to gate

1 byte = 8 bits
	easy to store #s in BCD format (see Ch23)
	also can store most written languages, shades of gray (ppl can differentiate 
		256 shades)

1 nibble = 4 bits

octal = base-8 # system
	to convert binary to octal: take 3 bits & convert 
	problem: a binary # that's 16-bits != 2 8-bit #s
			10110011 11000101	= 131705
			10110011		= 263
				 11000101	= 305

representations of multibyte values is consistent w/representations of 
	individual bytes

hexadecimal = base-16 system 
	allows each byte is divided into equal # of bits
	0-9, a-f

Julius Caesar assassinated on "ides (15th) of March"

fortnight = 14 days
	full moon occurs 1 fortnight after new moon

converting decimal => hex (for #s upto 65,565)
		      xxx 
  divide by 256	   __/   \__	  divide by 256
	          /         \
	         yyy        zzz
  divide by 16  _/ \_	   _/ \_  divide by 16
	       /     \    /     \
	     aaa    bbb  ccc   ddd

if remainder: take xxx - [whole #(xxx/D)*D], where D = current divisor

2-digit signed #s = negative when hex begins w/8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f
