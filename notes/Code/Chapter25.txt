Chapter 25 - The Graphical Revolution
----------------------------------------
Vannevar Bush - 
	Director of the Office of Scientific Research & Development
	"As We May Think" essay in Life magazine, 1945
	Memex - device that stores books, articles, records, pictures, etc

UI = point where human & computer meet
	
teletypewriter 
	earliest interactive computer
	user types line
	computer responds w/multiple lines
	all in ASCII, proceeds down roll of paper

CRT = cathode ray tube
	software can treat entire screen as 2D platform for info
	to keep display output logic of OS generalized, use CRT like "glass teletypewriter"
	ie. UNIX
	ASCII not enough, ANSI creates "Additional Controls for Use with American National Std Code for Information Interchange"
	
dumb terminal = keyboard + CRT responding to ASCII codes coming from a remote computer

raster display = total image made up of series of horizontal raster lines drawn by an electron gun that shoots a beam quickly 

increasing # of possible colors = more bits per pixel = incresae memory requirements of display adapter

color depth/resolution = # of bits per pixel
	# of colors = 2^(# of bits per pixel)

Douglas Engelbart
	worked on computer interfaces
	mid 1960's - 
		@ Sanford Research Institute
		created 5-prong keyboard & the mouse

1970 - Xerox founds the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to develop new ideas for computer interfaces
	Alto computer
		designed/built in 1972-1973
		built from 200 ICs
		BW screen = 8.5"x11"
		total amt of memory for video display was part of address space of processor => can draw pictures w/mouse
		use mouse to interact with object on screen
		multiple programs put into windows & shown all at once

1972 - PARC creates Smalltalk, 1st version of OOP		
1979 - Steve Jobs visits PARC & Alto
1984 - creates Macintosh (inspired by Alto) & Mac OS

text-based single-user OS: small size, little API
graphical OS: large, many API functions (each named after its purpose)
	must provide way for program to display grpahics on screen (draw lines,circles,etc)
	use same API for video memory & printer (what you see is what you get - WYSISYG)

Mac OS only supports 1 type of hard drive, video display, etc (b/c Apple builds both hardware & software)

for other computers, different hardware gets different levels of support & quality

high-level programming languages
	Macintosh = Pascal
	Windows = C

C++
	developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, Bell Telephone Labs
	1st developed as translator to convert c++ to c (though unreadable)

RTF = rich text format
	by Microsoft
	exchange formatted text among apps

computer graphics
	vector graphics
		create images algorithmically via lines, curves, etc
		stored in metafile (collection of vector graphics drawing commands encoded as binary)
	raster/bitmap graphics
		encodes image as array of bits corresponding to each pixel of output image

CCD = charge-coupled device
	semiconductor releases electrical charge when exposed to light
	1 CCD cell needed for each pixel to be sampled
	ie. scanner - row of CCD sweep along surface of image
	    video cameras - 2D array of CCD
	    
data compression
	lossless compression
		original file can be recreated, sometimes results w/size of compressed file >> original file
		RLE = run-length encoding = record # of times same pixel value used
		LZW = Lempel, Ziv, Welch algorithm = detect patterns of differently valued pixels    
	lossy compression
		original data is discarded during compression, can't recreate 
		JPEG = Joint Photography Experts Group
		
digitized sound
	1983 - advent of CD by Philips & Sony
		stored 74min of sound 
		length chosen so Beethoven's Nineth Symphony can fit on 1 CD

sound encoded via PCM = pulse code modulation
	ADC = analog - digital converter = converts analog # to binary
	DAC = digital - analog converter = convert electrical signal (binary) to analog
	sampling rate = constant rate which the voltage represents sound wave converted to digital value
	
1928 - Harry Nyquist (Bell Labs) shows sampling rate >= 2x max grequency needed to be recorded & played back

MIDI = musicical instr digital interface	
	digital values stored on CD as holed carved into surface
	read w/laser light

telephone system can't transmit bits, only sound
	therefore, need to move from sound => bits => sound

carrier = continuous sound wave of single freq & amplitude
	can modulate (change) sound waves to emulate binary

modem = modulator/demodulator
	device to convert sound to bits
	form of serial interface (1 bit sent @ a time)
	able to convert 0,1 @ different rates 
	FSK = frequency-shift keying
		1 byte of data needs 10bits 
		each byte starts w/a start bit & ends w/ stop bit + 8 data bits

BBS = bulletinboard system

TCP/IP = transmission control protocol & Internet protocol
	method for computers to talk to each other
		divide blocks of data into packets & sent separately

HTTP = hypertext transfer protocol
	data on webpage defined by HTML (ASCII text w/formatting info)
	server side code = computer storing original web pages
		handled w/ CGI (common gateway scripts
	client side code = code running on local computer
		Javascript
		
Java program compiled to Java byte code (like assembly) & runs on JVM (Java virtual
 machine)
 	JVM allows for platform independent programming
