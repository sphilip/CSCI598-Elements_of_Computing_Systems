Test Design is based on the "Equivalence partition" testing approach
According to "Hack" specification there are 8 types of jumps and 3 major input
values :
		IN > 0
		IN < 0
		IN == 0
Which gives 24	test cases, given that 3 valid partitions are >0, 0 and >0.
Test specification is given by 2 .asm files - for CPU and the topmost CHIP.
The difference in design is caused by the absence of memory in the CPU chip,
where input values should be explicitly assigned before jumps, apart from that
they are similar.

Tests are divided into 2 parts - jumps and non-jumps for all 3 partitions.
	non-jumps - values frmo invalid partitions (jumps are not performed)
	jumps - values from valid partitions (jumps are performed)
