	CPUnomemory.tst - testing CPU chip itself	
	CPUnomemory.asm - asm specification
	CPUnomemory.cmp - compare file
	
	copmuterJump.tst - testing jumps in a computer chip
	copmuterJump.asm - asm specification
	copmuterJump.cmp - compare file
				  
The major difference between  CPUnomemory and copmuterJump and is that CPU has no memory 
and values for jumps should be assigned explicitly right before the jump. 
The specifications for tests are done via .asm files.
